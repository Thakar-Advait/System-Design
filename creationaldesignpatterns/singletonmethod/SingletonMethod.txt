🏭 Singleton Method Pattern
📘 Concept

The Singleton Pattern ensures only one instance of a class exists throughout the application — and provides a global access point to it.

⚙️ How It Works

You store the instance in a private variable.
The constructor is hidden or restricted.
The global access function (GetInstance()) creates the instance only once, using thread-safe logic.
👉 Every call returns the same instance.

🧠 Why Use It

You need a shared, single point of access.
You want to avoid multiple connections or configurations being created.

💼 Use Cases

Database connections
Logger systems
Configuration managers
Caches
Metrics collectors
