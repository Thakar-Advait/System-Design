🏭 Abstract-Factory Method Pattern
📘 Concept

The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related objects — without specifying their concrete classes.
It’s like a factory of factories.

⚙️ How It Works

You define abstract product interfaces (e.g., Button, Textbox).
Each factory implementation (e.g., LightFactory, DarkFactory) produces a consistent family of products (LightButton, LightTextbox).
Client code requests a factory, then uses it to create related objects.
👉 The client gets consistent object families without knowing implementation details.

🧠 Why Use It

When you need to ensure consistency among related products.
When your system supports multiple variants (themes, platforms, environments).
To avoid mixing incompatible object families.

💼 Use Cases

UI component sets (Light/Dark themes)
Database systems (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
Cloud providers (AWS/GCP services)
Cross-platform apps (Windows/macOS UI)
