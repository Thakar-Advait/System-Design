🏭 Builder Method Pattern
📘 Concept

The Builder Pattern constructs complex objects step by step instead of requiring a huge constructor with many parameters.
It separates the construction process from the representation.

⚙️ How It Works

You define a Builder interface with methods for each configurable part.
Each method returns the builder itself, enabling method chaining.
The final Build() method returns the assembled object.
👉 Each step modifies internal state; the final Build() produces a complete object.

🧠 Why Use It

When object creation involves multiple optional parameters.
When the object’s construction is complex or multi-step.
When you want readable, chainable configuration code.

💼 Use Cases

Building configuration objects (HTTP request, SQL query)
Assembling complex models (Computer, House, Resume)
Constructing immutable objects in multiple steps
