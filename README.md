# System Design & Design Patterns - Code Examples

A comprehensive collection of design pattern implementations and system design examples, written in **Go**. This repository serves as a practical learning resource for understanding software design patterns through hands-on implementation.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository exists to:

- **Learn by Doing**: Understand design patterns through real-world implementations rather than just theory
- **Build Practical Skills**: See how design patterns solve actual software engineering problems
- **Practice System Design**: Work through complex problems that combine multiple patterns
- **Reference Guide**: Serve as a code reference for implementing patterns in your own projects

The repository currently focuses on **Creational Design Patterns**, with each pattern demonstrated through multiple practice problems that progressively build understanding. It also includes complex problems that combine multiple patterns to solve real-world scenarios.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.19+** installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Go programming language

### Running Examples

Navigate to any problem directory and run:

```bash
cd creationaldesignpatterns/abstractfactorymethod/pq1
go run main.go
```

Or build and run:

```bash
go build
./pq1  # or the executable name
```

## 🎓 Learning Path

1. **Start with Individual Patterns**: Begin with `pq1` problems to understand the basic pattern
2. **Progress Through Variations**: Move through `pq2`, `pq3`, `pq4` to see different applications
3. **Tackle Complex Problems**: Challenge yourself with multi-pattern problems in `complexproblems/`
4. **Study the Code**: Read the implementations, understand the design decisions, and experiment with modifications

## 🔮 Coming Soon

This repository is actively being developed. More design pattern categories and system design concepts will be added.

Stay tuned for updates! 🎉

## 💡 Why Go?

Go was chosen for this repository because:

- **Simplicity**: Clean syntax makes patterns easy to understand
- **Interfaces**: Powerful interface system perfect for demonstrating design patterns
- **Practical**: Widely used in production systems
- **Concurrency**: Built-in support for concurrent patterns

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a learning repository. Feel free to:
- Study the code
- Experiment with modifications
- Suggest improvements or report issues

## 📝 License

This repository is for educational purposes. Use the code examples to learn and understand design patterns.

**Happy Learning!** 🚀

*Remember: Understanding design patterns is not about memorizing implementations, but about recognizing when and how to apply them to solve real-world problems.*
