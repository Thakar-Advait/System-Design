🏭 Factory Method Pattern
📘 Concept

The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses or functions decide which class to instantiate.
It decouples object creation logic from the main business logic.

⚙️ How It Works

You define a common interface (Notifier).
Concrete implementations (EmailNotification, SMSNotification) implement that interface.
A factory function (or class) takes input and returns the correct implementation.
👉 The calling code doesn’t care which concrete type it gets — just that it satisfies the Notifier interface.

🧠 Why Use It

You need to create objects based on runtime parameters.
You want to encapsulate object creation logic in one place.
You expect the creation logic to change often or expand (adding new types).

💼 Use Cases

1. Notification services (email, SMS, push)
2. Payment gateways (PayPal, Stripe)
3. Report exporters (PDF, CSV, HTML)
4. Shape/Widget creation in graphics software
